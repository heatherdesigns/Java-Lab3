<p>Homework assginment: For your birthday, your grandparents gave you a $500 gift card for Best Buy. They will go shopping with you and will help carry out your items. The most that each of you can carry is one item in each hand. Thus, you may purchase a maximum of six items. You will have a tracker device that computes the number of items you purchase as well as the amount of money you have spent. After you choose each item, the tracker prompts you for the price, and then displays the amount of money you have spent. Then it displays the number of items you may still choose and how much is left to spend. The program will not terminate until you reach 6 items or $500, whichever comes first. At that point, the tracker will confirm you are finished shopping for the day and will list how much you spent on how many items.</p>

<p>Required:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate that negative prices are not entered. Give the user as many opportunities as needed to enter a price above 0. Users should be able to purchase items costing one penny.</li>
    <li>All dollar amounts should be formatted for currency using the NumberFormat class.</li>
   </ul>
<p>Be sure to test for all options, i.e., you may use the entire dollar amount on fewer than 6 items, or you may spend less than the entire amount on 6 items, or you may spend the entire dollar amount on exactly 6 items.</p>
